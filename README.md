#### Backend: choose [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): real-time database, cross-platform API w/ minimal, whole ecosystem for mobile dev
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): flexible and scalable, uses JSON, part of the popular MERN stack, focuses on data storage

### APIs: many options, you're not limited to this list :)
There's lots of [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) to look at: 
* [Insight: Mars Weather Service API](https://api.nasa.gov/assets/insight/InSight%20Weather%20API%20Documentation.pdf)
  * Provides per-Sol summary data for each of the last 7 available Sols (Martian Days)
  * Data from InSight Mars lander: continues weather measurements of temperature, wind, and pressure at Elysium Planitia (flat smooth plain near Marâ€™s equator)
* Mars Rover Photos API
  * Collects image data from NASAâ€™s Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit Mars rovers
  * Photos organized by the sol (Martian day) which they were taken
  * Can also search by Earth date (probably more useful for this app) and filter photos by each camera
  * Mission manifest: list details of Roverâ€™s mission (e.g. name, landing date, launch date, mission status, etc.)
* [Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI)](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/donki/)
  * Daily interpretations of space weather observations, analysis, forecasts
  * Geomagnetic Storm (GST), Interplanetary Shock (IPS), Solar Flare (FLR), etc. APIs
* Asteroids - Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API
  * Search for asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth
There's also plent of other space-related APIs out there, feel free to add to this list: 
* [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/)
  * Get the current number of people in space, along with their names and spacecraft if known
